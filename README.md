# csvcompare
 
filecompare.ps1 takes two parameters:

    -inputFilesDirectory  [path to files that were provided]
    -outputFilesDirectory [path to exported files]

Script is predicated on equivalent files in the two directories having the same filename and having .csv extension.

Analysis is output by default to new directory in the location that script is run from.
